* aria2c web interface, does omv have something for this?
  AFAIK https://github.com/ziahamza/webui-aria2 should do the trick
* React app to handle entering URI's and opening aria2c web interface
  ðŸ’¡ could review the edge-network-control reactapp I created?
* React app feature to grab uri's via yt-dlp (unrelated to spider/aria2c)
* What method can I use to verify recursive website mirroring/archiving?
  wget --spider --mirror ? see: original recursive-downloader.sh
